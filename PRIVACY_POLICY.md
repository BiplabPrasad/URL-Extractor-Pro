# Privacy Policy for URL Extractor Pro

**Effective Date:** [Date - e.g., April 10, 2024]

This Privacy Policy describes how the "URL Extractor Pro" Chrome Extension ("the Extension") handles your data.

## 1. Data Handled by the Extension

The Extension works with the following types of data:

- **User-Defined Regular Expressions:** The names and regex pattern strings you create and save within the Extension's "Manage Regex" tab.
- **Extraction History:** A list of the unique URLs that have been successfully extracted from web page HTML using your defined regex patterns, along with the timestamp when they were added to the history.

## 2. Data Storage

All data handled by the Extension (your regex patterns and extraction history) is stored **exclusively locally** on your computer using the `chrome.storage.local` API provided by the Chrome browser.

## 3. Data Collection and Transmission

The Extension **does not collect, transmit, send, share, or sell any of your data** (regex patterns, history, browsing activity, or any other personal information) to any external servers, databases, or third parties. All processing and storage occur entirely within your local browser instance.

## 4. How Data is Used

- **Regex Patterns:** Used solely by the Extension to scan the HTML of the web page you are currently viewing _when you explicitly click the "Extract URLs" button_.
- **Extraction History:** Used solely to display the log of previously extracted URLs within the Extension's "History" tab, allowing you to search, sort, and reopen those URLs.

## 5. Data Security

The Extension relies on the security mechanisms of the Chrome browser and the `chrome.storage.local` API for storing data locally.

## 6. Clearing Your Data

You can clear all data stored by the Extension (regex patterns and history) by:

- Uninstalling the Extension from your Chrome browser.
- Manually clearing browsing data associated with extensions through Chrome's settings (the exact steps may vary depending on your Chrome version).

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version of the Extension and in the externally hosted policy linked from the Chrome Web Store listing.
